# HSL.V2
HSL.V2 is an IOS application aiming for real-time bus tracking, accessibility, and inclusivity. The idea comes from a phenomenon that passengers have to wave their hands in Finland when they see the bus coming and we are concerned that people with myopia or having busy times missed their bus. The app is based on the HSL transportation app and implemented by Swift and Swift UI. Target users include regular HSL bus users, as well as anyone who has experienced the frustration of missing their  bus.

## Features
* Users choose as a passenger or driver in the first sign in, and allow the permission of location and notification.
* Passengers can search for the bus route and pin their location on the map.
* Drivers notice the red annotation in advance and stop at the correct bus station.
* Passengers' voice gets recognition.
* Users can shift their roles in the setting.
  
## Implementation
* GraphQL data format from HSL open data
* Polyline Library
* Core Data for annotation and user preference
* Speech Recognizer
* Multi-language
* Swift UI
